okay so the problem witht the AI system before is thaty it was very bulky, alot of lists, im wondering if i 
could just use intervals to move the enemies, but then the problem is no ai. research starts now
Alright, intervals arent that, they sequence events. they help to script actions
so it looks like that i will need to use lists and dictionaries again
ill make it complicated but with class and one dictionary 
One setup function
Ai start 
AI resume
and prob health
all added parameters, for excessive control,
also, ze click function will input the damage

okay s0o
enemy list hold the dioctionarieds right
then we reference the dictionary through ze list
looking like enemylist[dictname]
make the list a dict, 
enemydict['enemynode']['enemyname']

Clcik hit function, handles hits,
Constant update, chwck for enemy die, enemy ps, cause aidot update/aiworld, check for wave end, removing npcs
