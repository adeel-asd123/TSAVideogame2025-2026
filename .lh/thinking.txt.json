We need transmission type animation right?\nLook rq\nDone! usage is textTypewriteAnimation((0,0), 'sigma')\n\nalrifght wait before i forget this\nwe have 3 main tasks hbt.\nOne uodate function for frame by frame\none for checking plot progression, call it plotAdvancer\nand one the progress plot. call it plotLine\n2 asyncfutures for each event. First PA reports to PL, telling it that event has occured\nthen a second async reports back, telling it the event is done.\nevent list, [(lambda x: x=True, lambda: print('event1')), (lambda y: y=True, lambda: print('event2'))]\nExample\n\nfor condition, event in eventlist:\n    if condition:\n        event()\n        await event1done\nreturn task.return\n\nthen here\nPL:\nawait event1start\n#whatever\nevent1Done.set_result\nawait event2start"
